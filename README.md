zkIntrospector: A Self-Aware zkApp Framework for GÃ¶del Number Reflection


idea:

0. Be able to encode any source code into a numeric field via
ast introspection, ast flattening, prime number assignment to each field, 
feature selection, multiplication. 
This encoder function will encode itself into a number as well.
We can apply the function to itself to evaluate itself.

1. Represent o1js ts,snarky ocaml, libsnark C++ as a single numeric field each.
2. Represent openmina rust as a single numeric field.

3. Treat each system as a data type or a set. Each type is a point in that field. 
Create a diagonalization of these systems that allows for statements to include elements from each set.
Create statements of proof. 
4. Porting of meta-coq and template Haskell terms into this system.
5. Be able to translate from one vernacular to the others.
6. Now we can implement obserability functions to record execution like perf record and strace and ltrace.
7. We can expand the dependencies of each tool and introspect all other packages needed.
8. We can use nix and guix to manage the dependencies.
9. We can create functions that call LLMs in type script and later python and pass those return values into the block-chain.
10. We can create a buy order to introspect the entire mina system this way and feed all its data to LLMs.
