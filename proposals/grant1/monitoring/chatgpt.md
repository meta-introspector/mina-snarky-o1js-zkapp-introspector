### Title
Augmenting TypeScript pnpm Test Job with Performance Recording and Profiling in Docker

### Project Background
The current project involves optimizing and enhancing the testing environment for a TypeScript application using `pnpm` in a Docker container. The focus is on integrating performance recording and function-level profiling to identify and address performance bottlenecks. More information on the Docker and pnpm setup can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [here](https://pnpm.io/).

### Proposal Overview

#### Problem
Existing TypeScript testing environments often lack detailed performance analysis tools, leading to difficulties in identifying performance issues and inefficiencies. This gap impedes the optimization of applications and slows down the development process.

#### Solution
This proposal aims to enhance the TypeScript testing job by integrating performance recording and function-level profiling tools within a Docker container managed by Docker Compose. The approach includes modifying Docker configurations, installing profiling tools, updating test scripts, and analyzing the profiling results to improve performance.

#### Impact
By implementing this proposal, the Mina ecosystem will benefit from improved tools for performance analysis, fostering better code quality and optimization practices. This will attract more developers and users interested in high-performance TypeScript applications, contributing to the overall adoption and innovation within the ecosystem.

#### Audience
The primary audience includes developers and teams using TypeScript with `pnpm` in Docker containers. This also extends to those interested in performance optimization and profiling in development environments.

### Architecture & Design

#### Detailed Design/Architecture
The proposal involves updating the Docker Compose configuration to support profiling tools and modifying the Dockerfile to include these tools. Profiling utilities such as Clinic or Node.js's built-in profilers will be installed. Test scripts will be updated to enable profiling during test runs. Profiling results will be analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks.

1. **Docker Compose Configuration**: Update `docker-compose.yml` to support profiling commands and environment variables.
2. **Dockerfile Modifications**: Install profiling tools and set up the environment for performance testing.
3. **Test Script Updates**: Modify `package.json` scripts to include profiling options and commands.

#### Vision
The long-term vision is to establish a robust performance profiling framework for TypeScript applications, making it a standard practice in development environments. This will lead to higher performance standards and more efficient development processes within the Mina ecosystem.

#### Existing Work
The current project setup is available [here](https://github.com/example/repository). This repository contains the existing Docker and pnpm configuration.

#### Production Timeline
The project is expected to be in production within 1-2 months of funding, including time for configuration, implementation, and testing.
