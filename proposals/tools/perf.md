### perf

The Linux `perf` tool is designed as a root-level observability system that provides powerful and efficient sampling of any running program at runtime. It allows users to set up user probes (also known as `uprobes`) to monitor, interrupt, and sample various performance metrics without the need for modifying the source code of the program being observed.

Key features include:
- **Event-driven Sampling**: `perf` captures data based on specific performance events (e.g., CPU cycles, cache misses, page faults) and can provide insights into the behavior of programs.
- **User Probes (Uprobes)**: This feature allows users to monitor user-space applications by dynamically inserting probes at function entry/exit points or arbitrary code locations. 
- **Kernel Probes (Kprobes)**: Similar to uprobes, `kprobes` allow for monitoring kernel events.
- **Low Overhead**: Designed for minimal performance impact, enabling efficient data collection and analysis even in production environments.
- **Broad Scope**: It can monitor not only the application-level events but also system-wide events such as scheduler activities, disk I/O, network performance, and more.

With `perf`, developers and administrators gain detailed visibility into how programs interact with hardware, the kernel, and the rest of the system, making it invaluable for performance tuning, debugging, and system optimization.
